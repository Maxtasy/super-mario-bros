- Add crouch, which halves height and will reduce ground friction if character is big
- fireBar (object)
- Cutscenes
- Pyranhas
- Piranha on warp pipes
- Add fireBall for fieryMario
- only red koopas dont walk off ledges, unless they were red koopa paratroopers before
- Shrinking mario = 8sec invis + flashing animation
- Starman 30sec, bounce animation after spawning
- koopatroopa.state = "hidden" instead of spawning shell, respawning KoopaTroopa after 13 seconds
- Shell destroying enemies
- Damage enemy/collect coin uptop block if hit/bounced
- Â½ block away from pipe = no piranha, same with cannons
- bowser has 5 hp, each fireball takes 1 away
- show lives, points, time, coins on top of screen
- levels have different time limits, add to world data
- 1Up mushroom appearance is actually is a bit more limited (read reference)
- 100 coins = 1 + life
- Maybe tweak friction, acceleration, maybe add air friction
- Credit pixel art scaler, reference picture websites
- Flagpole point regions
- becoming big / uncrouching under narrow space = moonwalk to right until unstuck
- If we die after clearing 50% of the level, we spawn in the middle, except 4-4
- If jump is held character jumps a little bit higher, set gravity -.05 or something (bonus yaccel?)
- Major cleanups

Game logic:

1.) Initial state
2.) User wants to move
3.) Pseudo move character model to desired location
4.) Check if any collisions would happen
4.1) Move him in closest place of collision, set velocity of this axis to 0
4.2) Check if we have to scroll screen (did mario cross the magic border? Do we have any more level to the rigth? How far did he cross the border?)
4.3) Apply this deltaX to all objects (mario, background, blocks, etc.) game.scroll()
5.) Draw everything
