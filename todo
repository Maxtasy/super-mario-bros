- Add checkpoints object into TeleportTrigger, requirement to avoid teleport
- Maybe create bowserBridge class for axe transition / Axe transition (remove bridge, freeze bowser, let him fall down)
- Clean up worldData -> piranhas, add them into pipes
- "Thank you Mario! But our princess is in another castle!"
- levelEndLine in castle is closest to mushroomRetainer
- elevatorPlatform.type "falling" does only go down when mario is on it
- 2-4 & 5-4 & 6-2-2: elevatorPlatforms are size 1.5 normally, I made it 2. Maybe fix
- Fix Bloober movement
- Some bowsers throw nails
- Fix jumpingBoard (Jump off the Jumping Board as Mario is bouncing on it to give his jump a little extra height. With the right timing, Mario can leap 10¼ blocks from the top of Jumping Board. )
- Red KoopaTroopas walk off ledges if they were KoopaParatroopers before
- Add Flagpole score regions (see reference for details)
- Implement time mechanic (levels have different time limits, add to world data, 1 ingame second = .6 real seconds)
- Implement Coin collect mechanic (100 coins = +1 life)
- Implement Score mechanic
- 1Up mushroom appearance is actually is a bit more limited (see reference for details)
- Credit pixel art scaler, reference picture websites
- becoming big / uncrouching under narrow space = moonwalk to right until unstuck
- If we die after clearing 50% of the level, we spawn in the middle, except 4-4
- If jump is held character jumps a little bit higher, set gravity -.05 or something (bonus yaccel?)
- Major cleanups
- Sometimes shells don't kill enemies if they are too close, maybe fix
- Does timer reset after sublevel?
- Put bowser in enemy class
- Put axes into tiles with special collision
- Adjust timeLimit for all levels
- Only one lakitu on screen at a time
- Check in whch levels we have infinite bulletBills
- Sometimes enemies are in wrong place after scrollOffset (lvl 1 near flag)

Game logic:

1.) Initial state
2.) User wants to move
3.) Pseudo move character model to desired location
4.) Check if any collisions would happen
4.1) Move him in closest place of collision, set velocity of this axis to 0
4.2) Check if we have to scroll screen (did mario cross the magic border? Do we have any more level to the rigth? How far did he cross the border?)
4.3) Apply this deltaX to all objects (mario, background, blocks, etc.) game.scroll()
5.) Draw everything
