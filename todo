Game logic:

1.) Initial state
2.) User wants to move
3.) Pseudo move character model to desired location
4.) Check if any collisions would happen
4.1) Move him in closest place of collision, set velocity of this axis to 0
4.2) Check if we have to scroll screen (did mario cross the magic border? Do we have any more level to the rigth? How far did he cross the border?)
4.3) Apply this deltaX to all objects (mario, background, blocks, etc.) game.scroll()
5.) Draw everything
